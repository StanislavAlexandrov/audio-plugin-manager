# macOS Audio Plugin Manager

a simple app built with Python tkinter to scan and manage my audio plugins (VST, VST3, AU).

It provides a clean list of what's installed, includes brief descriptions for many common plugins, and offers a safe way to delete them. The script intelligently asks for an admin password only when deleting system-level files.

To run it, just use:

```sh
python3 plugin_manager.py
```
